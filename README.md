# README

This repository contains the source code that will be used to run UCSD's IEEE Team 1 Micromouse for the 2016-2017 year. Currently in the early stages of development.

## Current Implementation Objectives:
* Determine C vs C++ pros/cons and choose a language

* Determine language limitations

	    1. MBed's libraries *(.dll's)*
		2. Project Futura ST Libraries *(stm32f4xx_foo.c's)*
	+ etc
	
* Develop __Classes__ for:
	1. Main
	2. Maze __(possibly nested cell class)__
    3. Motor
	4. Encoder _(maybe nest in motor)_
	5. IR Sensor
	6. Gyro
	
* Develop __Headers__ *(Sets of Functions)* for:
